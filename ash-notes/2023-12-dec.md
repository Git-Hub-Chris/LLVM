LLVM core components:
1. Clang frontend: generates LLVM bitcode
2. libc++ C++ standard library: ISO/IE 14882 standard; after object files/IR, references are resolved by linking with libc++ implementations
3. LLD linker: makes one single .exe/library; static linking: all dependencies included; dynamic linking: dependencies linked at runtime)

useful info of internals of LLVM generated from source-code: https://llvm.org/doxygen/index.html 


llvm/cmake

generates system build files

/modules: build config for llvm user-defined options. checks compiler version and linker flags

/platforms: toolchain configuration for Android NDK, iOS systems, and non-Windows hosts to target MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler)



llvm/examples

examples for using LLVM for a custom language (lowering, optimization, and code generation)

Kaleidoscope language tutorial: hand-written lexer, parser, AST, as well as codegen support using LLVM both static (ahead of time) and various approaches to Just in time (JIT) compilation

JIT: program is compiler into machine code during runtime, right before it's executed

BuildingAJIT: shows how LLVM's ORC JIT APIs interact with other parts of LLVM. teaches how to recombine them to build a custom JIT that is suited to your use-case
