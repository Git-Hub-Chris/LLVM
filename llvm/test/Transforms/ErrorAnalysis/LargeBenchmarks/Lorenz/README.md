The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations notable for having chaotic solutions for certain 
parameter values and initial conditions.

The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations:



The equations relate the properties of a two-dimensional fluid layer uniformly warmed from below and cooled from above. 
In particular, the equations describe the rate of change of three quantities with respect to time: x is proportional to 
the rate of convection, y to the horizontal temperature variation, and z to the vertical temperature variation. The 
constants σ, ρ, and β are system parameters proportional to the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and certain physical 
dimensions of the layer itself.

One normally assumes that the parameters σ, ρ, and β are positive. Lorenz used the values σ = 10, β = 8 / 3 and ρ = 28. 
The system exhibits chaotic behavior for these (and nearby) values.

If ρ < 1 then there is only one equilibrium point, which is at the origin. This point corresponds to no convection. All 
orbits converge to the origin, which is a global attractor, when ρ < 1.
