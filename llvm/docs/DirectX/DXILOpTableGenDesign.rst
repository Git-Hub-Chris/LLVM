Introduction
============

`DirectXShaderCompiler <https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler>`_
encapsulates, among other information, various DXIL Operations in
`hctdb.py <https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/utils/hct/hctdb.py>`_.
DXIL Operations are represented in one of the following `two ways
<https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/130877392c263888ef06bab768856d3dab1f1c9a/docs/DXIL.rst#L1978>`_:

#. Using LLVM instructions
#. Using LLVM External functions. These are represented in LLVM IR as follows:

  * "Standard" LLVM intrinsics (e.g., ``llvm.sin.*``) and
  * HLSL intrinsics (defined as LLVM intrinsics in ``llvm/include/llvm/IR/IntrinsicsDirectX.td``, e.g., ``llvm.dx.*``)

  These are  collectively referred to as `LLVM Intrinsics` in this note.

Following is the complete list of properties of DXIL Ops with the corresponding field name
as used in ``hctdb.py``, if one exists. A DXIL Op is represented by a set of associated properties

1. Name of operation (``dxil_op``)
2. The generic or HLSL-specific intrinsic that maps to the operation (``llvm_name``).
3. Unique Integer ID (``dxil_opid``)
4. Operation Class signifying the name and function signature of the operation (``dxil_class``).
   This string is an integral part of the DXIL Op function name and is constructed in
   the format ``dx.op.<class-name>.<overload-type>``. The DXIL validator checks for any
   deviation from this for each of the DXIL Op call.

5. List of valid overload types for the operation (``oload_types``).
6. Required minimum Shader Model version with support for the operation. (``shader_model``).
7. Required minimum DXIL version with support for the operation.
8. Minimum shader model required with translation by linker (``shader_model_translated``)
9. List of shader stages the operation is applicable to (``shader_stages``); empty if applicable to all stages.
10. Memory access attributes of the operation (``fn_attr``).
11. Boolean attributes of operation to indicate if it

   * is some kind of a derivative (``is_derivative``)
   * requires gradient calculation (``is_gradient``)
   * is a sampler feedback (``is_feedback``)
   * requires in-wave, cross-lane functionality (``is_wave``)
   * requires that all of its inputs are uniform across the wave (``requires_uniform_inputs``).
   * is a barrier operation (``is_barrier``).

12. A string that documents the operation (``doc``)

Motivation
==========

DXIL backend passes depend on the knowledge of various properties of DXIL Operations.
For example, ``DXILLowering`` pass will need information such as the DXIL operation an
LLVM intrinsic is to be lowered to, along with valid overload and parameter types etc.
TableGen file - ``llvm/lib/Target/DirectX/DXIL.td`` - is used to represent DXIL Operations
by specifying their properties listed above. ``DXIL.td`` is designed to be the single source
of reference of DXIL Operations for DXIL backend implementation in ``llvm-project`` repo -
analogous to ``hctdb.py`` for ``DirectXShadeCompiler`` repo. It needs to have a rich
representation capabilities that TableGen backends (such as ``DXILEmitter``) can rely on.
Additionally, the DXIL Op specification should be easy to read and comprehend.

Design
======

1. Each DXIL Operation is represented as a TableGen record. The name of each of the records
   signifies operation name.
2. The LLVM Intrinsic that maps to the operation is represented using ``Intrinsic::*``.
3. The unique operation id is represented by an integer.
4. DXIL Operation Class is represented as follows

   .. code-block::

        // Abstraction of DXIL Operation class.
        // It encapsulates an associated function signature viz.,
        // returnTy(param1Ty, param2Ty, ...) represented as a list of LLVMTypes.
        // DXIL Ops that belong to a DXILOpClass record the signature of that DXILOpClass

        class DXILOpClass<list<LLVMType> OpSig> {
          list<LLVMType> OpSignature = OpSig;
        }

   Concrete operation classes, such as ``unary`` are defined inheriting from ``DXILOpClass``.
5. Valid overload types are represented as a list of ``LLVMType`` s.
6. Concrete records of Shader Model version and DXIL versions and are defined
   by inheriting from the class

   .. code-block::

        // Abstract class to represent major and minor version values
        class Version<int major, int minor> {
          int Major = major;
          int Minor = minor;
        }

7. Shader stages for which the operation is applicable are represented as a list of
   concrete records that inherit from the Class

   .. code-block::

      class ShaderStage;


8. All remaining properties of the operation are represented as a list as of concrete records
   that inherit from the class

   .. code-block::

      class OpAttributes;

   - memory access - ``ReadNone``, ``ReadNone``
   - ``IsDerivative``, ``IsGradient``, ``IsFeedback``, ``IsWave``, ``NeedsUniformInputs``, ``IsBarrier``

9. A documentation string for the operation.


A DXIL Operation is represented by the following TableGne class by encapsulating the various
TableGen representations of its properties described above.

.. code-block::

  // Abstraction DXIL Operation
  class DXILOpPropertiesBase {
    int OpCode = 0;                           // Opcode of DXIL Operation
    DXILOpClass OpClass = UnknownOpClass;     // Class of DXIL Operation.
    Intrinsic LLVMIntrinsic = ?;              // LLVM Intrinsic DXIL Operation maps to
    list<LLVMType> OpOverloadTypes = ?; // Valid overload type
                                              // of DXIL Operation
    Version SMVer = ?;                        // Min Shader Model version
    Version SMVerLinker = ?;                  // Min Shader Model required for linking
    Version DXILVer = ?;                      // Min DXIL version
    list<ShaderStage> ShaderStages = ?;       // List of applicable shader stages
    list<OpAttributes> OpAttribs = ?;         // Operation attributes
    string Doc = "";                          // A short description of the operation
  }


The following convenience class is used to demonstrate the definitions of a couple of
operations:

  .. code-block::

      class DXILOpProperties<int opCode,
                    Intrinsic intrinsic,
                    list<LLVMType> overloadTypes,
                    string doc> : DXILOpPropertiesBase {
        int OpCode = opCode;
        Intrinsic LLVMIntrinsic = intrinsic;
        list<LLVMType> OpOverloadTypes = overloadTypes;
        string Doc = doc;
      }

Additionally, following definition of ``unary`` class is also used:

.. code-block::

   def unary : DXILOpClass<[llvm_any_ty, LLVMMatchType<0>]>;

Following is the definition of ``Sin`` and ``Cos``

.. code-block::

   let OpClass = unary in {
     def Cos  : DXILOpProperties<12, int_cos, [llvm_half_ty, llvm_float_ty],
                                "Returns cosine(theta) for theta in radians.">;
     def Sin  : DXILOpProperties<13, int_sin, [llvm_half_ty, llvm_float_ty],
                           "Returns sine(theta) for theta in radians.">;
   }

Summary
=======

This note discusses the design of TableGen specification of DXIL Ops in ``DXIL.td``
that is intended to serve as a single source of reference for TableGen
backends (such as ``DXILEmitter`` - specific to DXIL backend), have an accurate
and rich specification, be readable and maintainable.
