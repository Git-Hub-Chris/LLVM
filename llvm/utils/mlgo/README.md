# MLGO Python Library

This folder contains the MLGO python library. This library consists of telling
to help enable ML applications within LLVM, particularly tooling to extract
corpora that can be used in downstream projects to train ML models and perform
other tasks that benefit from having a large amount of data.

### Python Versioning

Due to type annotations, the MLGO tooling currently only supports a Python
version greater than 3.8, deviating from the current LLVM project-wide
minimum supported version of Python 3.6.
